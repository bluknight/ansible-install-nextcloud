# ansible-install-nextcloud
This is a custom ansible installer for Nextcloud.  There's others out
there, but this is an opportunity to work on my Ansible skills, not to
mention my Git development skills.

Project (for what it is) is licensed under the MIT license.  All standard
caveats apply.  If your $SYSTEM catches fire from using my trash-pile of
code, it's not my fault.
